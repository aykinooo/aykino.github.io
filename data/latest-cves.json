      "summary": "Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. In versions 5.0.39 and below, origin validation uses startsWith() for comparison, allowing attackers to bypass the check by registering a domain that shares a common prefix with an allowed origin.The getAllowedOrigin() function checks if the Referer header starts with any allowed origin, and this comparison is insufficient as it only validates the prefix. This is exploitable when the origins array is configured and an attacker registers a domain starting with an allowed origin string (e.g., https://target.com.attacker.com bypasses https://target.com). On its own, tokens are still redirected to a configured origin. However, in specific scenarios an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow from an unauthorized origin and exfiltrate tokens, achieving full account takeover. This issue has bee fixed in version 5.0.40.",

      "summary": "Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. Versions 5.0.39 and below the redirect query parameter is appended to the base origin without validation, allowing attackers to steal access tokens via URL authority injection. This leads to full account takeover, as the attacker obtains the victim's access token and can impersonate them. The application constructs the final redirect URL by concatenating the base origin with the user-supplied redirect parameter. This is exploitable when the origins array is configured and origin values do not end with /. An attacker can supply @attacker.com as the redirect value results in https://target.com@attacker.com#access_token=..., where the browser interprets attacker.com as the host, leading to full account takeover. This issue has been fixed in version 5.0.40.",

      "summary": "eBay API MCP Server is an open source local MCP server providing AI assistants with comprehensive access to eBay's Sell APIs. All versions are vulnerable to Environment Variable Injection through the updateEnvFile function. The ebay_set_user_tokens tool allows updating the .env file with new tokens. The updateEnvFile function in src/auth/oauth.ts blindly appends or replaces values without validating them for newlines or quotes. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary environment variables into the configuration file. An attacker can inject arbitrary environment variables into the .env file. This could lead to configuration overwrites, Denial of Service, and potential RCE. There was no fix for this issue at the time of publication.",
