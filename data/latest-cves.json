      "summary": "A security vulnerability has been detected in feng_ha_ha/megagao ssm-erp and production_ssm up to 4288d53bd35757b27f2d070057aefb2c07bdd097. Impacted is an unknown function of the file EmployeeController.java. The manipulation leads to improper authorization. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. This product is distributed under two entirely different names. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",

      "summary": "Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. Versions 21.12.0 through 26.1.0 have a critical vulnerability in its SAML SSO implementation  which allows an attacker to take over any user account by using a malicious SAML Identity Provider and another organization on the same Sentry instance. Self-hosted users are only at risk if the following criteria is met: ore than one organizations are configured (SENTRY_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION = True), or malicious user has existing access and permissions to modify SSO settings for another organization in a multo-organization instance. This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0. To workaround this issue, implement user account-based two-factor authentication to prevent an attacker from being able to complete authentication with a victim's user account. Organization administrators cannot do this on a user's behalf, this requires individual users to ensure 2FA has been enabled for their account.",

      "summary": "Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. In versions 5.0.39 and below, all HTTP request headers are stored in the session cookie, which is signed but not encrypted, exposing internal proxy/gateway headers to clients. The OAuth service stores the complete headers object in the session, then the session is persisted using cookie-session, which base64-encodes the data. While the cookie is signed to prevent tampering, the contents are readable by anyone by simply decoding the base64 value. Under specific deployment configurations (e.g., behind reverse proxies or API gateways), this can lead to exposure of sensitive internal infrastructure details such as API keys, service tokens, and internal IP addresses. This issue has been fixed in version 5.0.40.",

      "summary": "Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. In versions 5.0.39 and below, origin validation uses startsWith() for comparison, allowing attackers to bypass the check by registering a domain that shares a common prefix with an allowed origin.The getAllowedOrigin() function checks if the Referer header starts with any allowed origin, and this comparison is insufficient as it only validates the prefix. This is exploitable when the origins array is configured and an attacker registers a domain starting with an allowed origin string (e.g., https://target.com.attacker.com bypasses https://target.com). On its own, tokens are still redirected to a configured origin. However, in specific scenarios an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow from an unauthorized origin and exfiltrate tokens, achieving full account takeover. This issue has bee fixed in version 5.0.40.",
